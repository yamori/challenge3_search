# CodeChallenge3 - Search

TBD

## Things I Learned

- `go mod init (package name)`, 
  - for this project `go mod init github.com/yamori/challenge3_search`
  - where `challenge3_search` is the name of the entry file, convention
- `go install`
  - executed locally will install to `$GOPATH/bin/`, and if this is on `PATH` it can then be used immediately
- VSCode - go extensions, auto complete etc.
